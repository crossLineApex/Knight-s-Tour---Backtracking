# Knight's-Tour---Backtracking

This project visualizes one of the famous Backtracking problems - Knight's Tour.
This visualization shows one of the possible paths a knight can take to cover the entire chessboard with possible moves.
This project is good to get started with HTML Canvas and getting started with Javascript and also helps the beginners to learn about Backtracking.

This project is similar to Hamiltonian path problem, more accurately 'Hamiltonian Cycle Problem' but takes linear time. Here the visualization is not a closed one.

Visualization can be seen from the CodePen link in the project section.
